<h1>Hi, I'm Abdul Basit!</h1>


As a dedicated cybersecurity analyst with over three years of proactive experience, I am driven by a profound commitment to safeguarding digital environments from ever-evolving threats. My journey began with an intrinsic fascination for computer systems, sparked by CompTIA A+and N+ videos, and has evolved into a robust career in cybersecurity.

Holding an associate degree in Computer Science, My educational background is complemented by extensive hands-on experience in setting up Security Operations Centers, employing advanced tools like Splunk, Qradar, Wazuh, Wireshark, and Nessus e.t.c to fortify defenses and mitigate risks.
